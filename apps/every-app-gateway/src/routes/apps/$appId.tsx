 * IMPORTANT: This is a LAYOUT ROUTE that persists across child route changes.
 *
 * This route structure prevents the embedded app iframe from hard-reloading
 * during client-side navigation:
 *
 * - Parent route: /apps/$appId (THIS FILE) - Renders the iframe, stays mounted
 * - Child route:  /apps/$appId/$ ($appId.$.tsx) - Handles sub-paths, can change freely
 *
 * When navigating from /apps/todo-app/history to /apps/todo-app/settings,
 * only the CHILD route component remounts - this PARENT layout stays mounted,
 * keeping the iframe alive. Route changes are communicated via postMessage.
 *
 * DO NOT combine these into a single catch-all route or the iframe will reload!
